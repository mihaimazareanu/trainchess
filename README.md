### trainchess

This is a small app created as part of a coding challenge for a job interview.

## Tech stack:

- Next.js
- styled-components

## Functionality

The app displays a regular chessboard. However, if you add in the URL /chessboard?start=e4 (for example), E4 will have a yellow writing and all the squares around the start position matching a knight move (either 2 squares horizontally and 1 square vertically or 1 square horizontally and 2 squares vertically) will have white text.
